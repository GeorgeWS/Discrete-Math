# Discrete-Math

Implementations of things learned in my Discrete Math class, MATH 029 at
Swarthmore College. Writing code is not a course requirement; just something I'm
choosing to do to help myself understand the material.

Inspired by the fact that a few of the things we've been learning are called
"algorithms" (e.g. the Euclidian Algorithm and the Division Algorithm), and
therefore seem suitable to practice by coding! :)
